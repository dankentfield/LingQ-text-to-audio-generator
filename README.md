# LingQ-text-to-audio-generator
A VERY simple web app to generate an audio mp3 from inputted text using AWS Polly.

This was a proof of concept to integrate into the old Lingq.com api, however I soon realised their api wasn't suitable for some of the integrations I wanted to make. E.g. automatically generating audio from text in the lingq.com api. 

##### Notes:
I have manually set the language to Russian for now, future releases will allow for language selection. 

##### Technologies used: 

+ AWS Polly
+ Bootstrap
+ JQuery
+ Javascript
